# SuperCounters
All the best implements to count the number of occurrences of an value in different containers types. At different stages from C to modern C++.

The task is to count number of occurences of a value in different scontainers types, take an array and a linked list for example.
With constrains of available technical facilities in different stages, which include:

C ... C/C++  ... C++ ... Modern C++

This is aimed to understand the benefits from language development over times.

C implementation - data structure processing via helper functions

C-CPP - operator overloading to make the traversal easier, like using a pointer over an array

CPP - using members function, class encapsulation and compatibilities with STL algorithms

Modern-CPP - checking for template type, for safer usage.
